/**
 * Collect info about available synonyms behavior implementations.
 *
 * If your module ships a synonyms behavior implementation you probably want to
 * implement this hook. However, exercise caution, if your synonyms behavior
 * implementation is a field-based one, you might be better off implementing
 * hook_synonyms_field_behavior_implementation_info().
 *
 * @param string $entity_type
 *   Entity type whose synonyms behavior implementations are requested
 * @param string $bundle
 *   Bundle name whose synonyms behavior implementations are requested
 * @param string $behavior
 *   Behavior name whose implementations are requested
 *
 * @return array
 *   Array of information about synonyms behavior implementations your module
 *   exposes. Each sub array will represent a single synonyms behavior
 *   implementation and should have the following structure:
 *   - provider: (string) machine name of your synonyms behavior implementation.
 *     Prefix it with your module name to make sure no name collision happens.
 *     Also, provider must be unique within the namespace of behavior, entity
 *     type and bundle. Basically, this is what distinguishes one behavior
 *     implementation from another
 *   - label: (string) Human friendly translated name of your synonyms behavior
 *     implementation
 *   - class: (string) Name of PHP class that implements synonyms behavior
 *     interface, which is stated in synonyms behavior definition. This class
 *     will do all the synonyms work. This hook serves pure declarative function
 *     to map entity types, bundles with their synonym behavior implementations
 *     whereas real "synonyms-related" work is implemented in your class
